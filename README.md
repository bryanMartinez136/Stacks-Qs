# Stacks-Qs
WeirdQueue implements the behavior of a Queue (FIFO) using two Stacks (LIFO) through the use of
the built-in Stack class in Java.
There is a no-arg constructor, an enqueue method which adds an item to the queue, and a dequeue method to remove from the queue.

The StackSorting class has a sort function that takes a Stack<Integer> s as input and returns a Stack<Integer>
with the elements of “s” sorted in descending order. The top of the stack is the largest value and the bottom 
of the stack holds the smallest value.
The elements of s is NOT copied into any other data structure such that sorting can be done on that data structure.
